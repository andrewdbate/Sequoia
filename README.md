# Sequoia: An Open Source OWL 2 DL Reasoner for Java

Welcome to the official repository for Sequoia!

Sequoia is an ontology reasoner that supports OWL 2 DL ontologies. Sequoia can be used from the command line, through
the Protégé plug-in, or via the OWL API.

Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests.

If you discover a bug, please report it [here](https://github.com/andrewdbate/Sequoia/issues) on GitHub.

Sequoia is free and open-source software that is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](https://github.com/andrewdbate/Sequoia/blob/master/LICENSE) only.

#### Current Limitations
 * Datatypes are not supported.
 * Neither nominals nor ABox assertions are supported.

## Development and Building

Sequoia is developed by [Andrew Bate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdbate/) and is actively maintained.

To build Sequoia, you will need [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed on your system.

The Sequoia reasoner is comprised of multiple subprojects:
 * `reasoner-macros` contains Scala macros used throughout the other subprojects.
 * `reasoner-kernel` contains the implementation of the core algorithm and data structures.
 * `reasoner-owl-api` contains the implementation of the OWL API bindings.
 * `reasoner-cli` contains the implementation of the command-line interface of the reasoner.
 * `reasoner-protege-plugin` contains the implementation of the Protégé plugin.

To compile all subprojects and run all tests in a single command, first clone this repository,
and then from the root directory, type `sbt test`. The tests will take several minutes to complete.

#### Building the Command-Line Client
From the root directory, type `sbt` to launch the SBT REPL. Then type `project cli` and hit Enter, followed by `universal:packageBin` and hit Enter.

#### Building the Protégé Plugin
From the root directory, type `sbt` to launch the SBT REPL. Then type `project protegeplugin` and hit Enter, followed by `osgiBundle` and hit Enter.
