 "The example to reproduce Issue 15: NullPointerException during classification when role chains axioms 
  contain inverse roles.  
 The cause of the problem is that the SubObjectPropertyOf axiom gets partially indexed, specifically 
 the binary object property chain (:T :T) is created. The NPE happens during the object property saturation, 
 when the optimization  REPLACE_CHAINS_BY_TOLD_SUPER_PROPERTIES is triggered for the chain (:T :T). 
 The reason is that (:T :T) does not occur in any role chain (hence it is eligible for the optimization), 
 but does not have any told super properties. Hence is NPE in IndexedPropertyChainSaturation.java line 328, 
 rev. 1150.")
